				I created this blog as a space to share my
				recovery journey with others in hopes that
				they too will find the courage to share
				their stories. Too often in Asian and Pacific
				Islander communities, silence and shame
				keep those who are addicted and their
				families in the dark. Living a life of
				recovery from addiction is very much like
				the lotus, we bloom out of a dark placeâ€¦
				renewed and resilient.
